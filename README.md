# AURORA & Teraga Lab (Android / Termux)

Self-healing AI operating system and Slovak language model lab running fully on Android (Termux, no root required).

## What is inside

- **AURORA core** – orchestration scripts for an AI OS (heartbeat, master orchestrators, nonstop learn loops).
- **Teraga-X lab** – Slovak transformer models with RMSNorm, RoPE, self-reflection, watchdog/doctor, and full diagnostic framework.
- **Monolithskbrain** – meta-brain with subsystems (emergent anatomy, qlora, anomaly detection, health monitoring, self-reflect).

This repository is a curated snapshot of a much larger private ecosystem running on a phone.
